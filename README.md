hola amigos!ðŸ¤™

I've created this ui chatbot as a sample for my main project.
You can copy the html,css and javascript files or download the project and use it as you wish.

In the javascript file just edit the API_KEY

const API_KEY = "****************************"

It would be like the above comment
You an generate your own API_KEY in the official openai website,and generate your own key and paste it in the js file and commit.

SAYONARA!ðŸ˜‰
